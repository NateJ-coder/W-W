# Workshop & Wireframe (W&W)

A tiny digital studio that builds personality-first websites, chatbots and online experiences.

## About

Workshop & Wireframe is a small, hands-on digital studio obsessed with making your business sound like *itself* online. We run a proper workshop to find your voice, then wireframe and build a site that finally sounds like you – not like a generic AI template.

## What We Do

- **Personality & brand voice workshops**
- **Websites that sound like you**
- **Chatbots that don't feel like robots**
- **Basic social media presence**
- **Fixing broken DIY / AI sites**
