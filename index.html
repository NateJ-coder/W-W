                <p>Workshop &amp; Wireframe is a small, hands-on digital studio obsessed with one thing: making your business sound like <em>itself</em> online.</p>
                <p>We're not a big agency and we're not a "fast AI website" generator. We're the in-between: a focused little team that actually listens, asks questions, and then builds your website, chatbot and basic social presence around your real personality, not around a template.</p>
                <p>When you work with W&amp;W, you get people who care about the story behind your business – why you started, who you serve, how you talk when you're relaxed – and we turn that into a clear, confident online presence.</p>

    <!-- What We Do -->

            <h2>What we do</h2>
            <div class="content-block">
                <p>At W&amp;W, we specialise in <strong>personality-driven online presence</strong> for small businesses, creators and service providers.</p>
                <p>We help you with:</p>
                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Personality &amp; brand voice workshops</strong> – simple, guided questions that pull your story, tone and "way of speaking" out of your head and into a usable voice guide.</li>
                    <li><strong>Websites that sound like you</strong> – clean, responsive sites that don't fall apart when you open the dev console and don't read like copy-paste AI.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chatbots that don't feel like robots</strong> – focused, friendly chat flows that answer FAQs, capture leads or help with bookings, written in your style.</li>
                    <li><strong>Basic social media presence</strong> – profile clean-ups, bio and about sections, and a starter batch of caption ideas that match your new voice.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fixing broken DIY / AI sites</strong> – taking what you already have and rebuilding it into something stable, fast and human-sounding.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="highlight-text">The end result is simple: when someone finds you online, they meet the <strong>real you</strong>, not a generic template.</p>

                <p>We keep the process simple and human:</p>
                <ol class="process-list">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Workshop</strong> – We sit down (online or in person) and ask the right questions about your business, your customers and your voice. No jargon, just conversation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Wireframe</strong> – We map out what your website and chatbot should say and where everything should live, so the structure fits your story and your goals.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Build &amp; refine</strong> – We design, develop and test the site and chatbot, then refine it with your feedback until it sounds and feels like you.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>From there, you can plug into one of our packages for ongoing tweaks, content and support – so your online presence can grow as your business grows.</p>
